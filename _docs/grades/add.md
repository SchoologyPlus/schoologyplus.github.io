# Adding New Assignments

Once grade editing is enabled, at the bottom of each category an italicized "Add Assignment" link will appear:

Either by clicking the edit button (the pencil) next to the dash or by clicking the "Add Assignment" text, you will be prompted to enter a grade for the new assignment:

Ensure the dash is selected (usually indicated by a blue highlight - if it is not, try clicking near it and pressing Ctrl+A), then type your desired grade.

## Entering new Grades

Grades are entered as `numerator / denominator`. Use a denominator of zero to simulate adding extra-credit.

Good examples:
* `3 / 3`
* `5 / 3` (extra-credit is OK)
* `1 / 0` (extra-credit is OK)
* `3/3` (spacing doesn't matter)

After you type your grade, **press enter** to create the assignment.

A new assignment will appear, a new "Add Assignment" row will appear, and the category and course grades will be updated to reflect what would change if that assignment was added. Added assignments have a light yellow background to distinguish themselves from real assignments.

If you would like to rename the added assignment, click on the assignment title, enter a new name, and press enter to save. This is only to help you keep track of your added assignments, and like every other change will disappear on a page reload.
