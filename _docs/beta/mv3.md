# Manifest V3 Beta Test

Welcome to the Schoology Plus Manifest V3 beta test! This beta test is a test of the new version of Schoology Plus that uses the new Manifest V3 extension format. This new format is required by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and will eventually be required by all Chromium-based browsers.

The extension has been substantially rewritten to use this new format, and as a result, there may be some bugs. Your job as a beta tester is to use the extension as normal and report any bugs you find!

## Joining the Beta

You must meet the following requirements to join the beta test:

- You must be using a personal computer or a school computer that **allows you to enable developer mode in your browser**
- You must be comfortable with manually installing extensions in your browser
- You must be willing to report any bugs you find

To join the Beta test, you will need to install the beta version of Schoology Plus. To do this, follow these steps:

If you have any issues with these steps, please ask for help in the `#support` or `#support-forum` channel on the [Schoology Plus Discord server](https://discord.schoologypl.us).

## Using the Beta

As soon as you install the beta version of Schoology Plus, the extension should be active and you should be able to use it as normal. You should see a Î² icon in the top left corner of your Schoology page indicating that you are using the beta version.

All features of the extension should work as normal, however your settings are not shared between the stable and beta versions of the extension. This means that you will need to re-enable any features that you had enabled in the stable version of the extension.

## Your Job as a Tester

As a beta tester, your main job is to use Schoology as normal and **find and report any bugs!** What's a bug? Good question! Here are some examples of things that *are* and *are not* bugs:

### Things that ARE bugs

- The extension crashes or stops working unexpectedly
- Features of the extension that work correctly on the stable version of Schoology Plus do not work as expected on the beta version
- Features of the extension that work correctly on the stable version of Schoology Plus are missing on the beta version
- The extension causes errors or issues on the Schoology website

### Things that ARE NOT bugs

- Requests for features that do not exist in the stable version of Schoology Plus
