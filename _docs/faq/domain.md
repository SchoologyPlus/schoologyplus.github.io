# Why doesn't Schoology Plus work for my school?

As of right now, Schoology Plus only officially supports schools using Schoology on a site with a URL in the form `<school>.schoology.com` as well as the LAUSD Schoology site (`lms.lausd.net`). We are currently in the process of beta-testing support for other URLs as well.

You can enable Schoology Plus on your school's Schoology site by opening the Schoology home page and then clicking "Enable Schoology Plus on this domain" from the three-dot (or right-click) menu on the Schoology Plus toolbar.

Please remember this is a beta feature and may not work as intended 100% of the time.
